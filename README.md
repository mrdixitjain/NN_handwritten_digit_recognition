This is a mini project to recognize handwritten digits using Neural Network with one hidden layer.

In this, we have used pure algorithm of neural network(not any inbuilt libraties).

Parameters.py contains the parameters derived by me over the given dataset.
Using these parameters, I've got a 99% accuracy on training data and 93% accuracy on test data.

NOTE : Data used in this exercise, was taken from the kaggle.com

If you want to derive your own parameters then, uncomment the line #211 from digit_recognition.py and comment the line #213.

may data with you :)

In second one, we have used keras CNN model on the same data.
